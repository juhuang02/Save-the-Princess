            The warrior princess, Diane, was stolen and her father and brother were struck down in the war. You are the only Knight left to save her. Your task is to navigate the enemy tribe's mazes and riddles to get to her and save the only heir to the thrown. You will need to use your physical stengths as well as your wits. Your mind is your biggest asset in this journey. If you fail, the empire will be thrown into turmoil, and will be overthrown by another tribe.
